# nlw-esports-unfinished

this is the NLW esports edition unfinished project

Next Level Week is a project by the Rocketseat Team to help developers reach a new carreer level.

This was my first attempt at using React and React Native. Although I wasn't able to complete the project, it was instrumental to my understanding of node.js, database, typescript, package and library usage, as well as the two aforementioned tools. I also gained experience with teamwork, having worked with other members of the community to complete the project and discuss solutions and mistakes on Discord.

WHAT I LEARNED TL;DR

- My first contact with React & React Native
- My first contact with real database and db tools (hoppscotch; postman)
- Experience with package and library (tailwind, vite, expo, babel)
- Experience with Node.JS
- Experience with Typescript
- Collaborative problem solving with other community members
